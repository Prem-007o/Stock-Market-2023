I took a stock market dataset from Kaggle that had daily prices for many big companies. First, I cleaned the data — removed duplicates, fixed missing values,
and made sure all the prices were in the right format. Then I used Power BI to analyze the data. 
I focused on the ‘Close’ price of each company’s stock and created visuals to compare them.
The chart shows which companies had the highest total closing prices over time,
so we can quickly see which stocks performed the best during that period.
